### Teste?

### Table of contents

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
rmd <- Sys.glob("*.Rmd")
rmd <- rmd[rmd != "index.Rmd"]
html <- sub(".Rmd", ".html", rmd)
lines <- lapply(rmd, readLines)
yaml <- lapply(lines, rmarkdown:::parse_yaml_front_matter)
cat("<ul>")
for (i in seq_along(rmd)) {
  cat(paste0("<li><a href='", html[i], "'>", yaml[[i]]$title, "</a><br/>",
             "<code>", rmd[i], "</code>", "</li>"))
}
cat("</ul>")
```




### What does this do?

As little as possible. The aim is to be very lightweight. But it does do this:

1. Includes an index page (you're looking at it) with a table of contents for every `.Rmd` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Inserts a navigation header into each rendered HTML file.
4. Sets some shared options for HTML documents rendered from R Markdown.
5. Contains a basic Makefile to render all the documents.
  
Don't forget to commit the HTML files that you generate. You can then configure GitHub to create a web page from the master branch, as [explained here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmullen/rmd-notebook) for the source. See the [R Markdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) if you want to do more.
