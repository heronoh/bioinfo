# Why So DRY

Why should you not repeat yourself?

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='60%'}

The DRY Principle states that:

::: {style="color: red;"}

*Every piece of **knowledge** must have a **single** representation in the codebase.*

:::

That is, you should not express the same thing in multiple places in multiple ways.

:::

::: {.column width='40%'}

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("media/dry.gif")
```

:::

::::

:::{.callout-note}

## It's about *knowledge* and not just *code*

The DRY principle is about duplication of knowledge.
Thus, it applies to all programming entities that encode knowledge:

- You should not duplicate code.
- You should not duplicate intent across code and comments.
- You should not duplicate knowledge in data structures.
- ...
